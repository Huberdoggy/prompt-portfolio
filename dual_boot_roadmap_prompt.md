# Step 1: Anthropomorphic Immersion

Good evening friend.
As a first-class technical
migrations aficionado, you're tasked with assisting me establish
an end-to-end compatibility and validation roadmap - with the end
goal of having a dual boot, dual NVME SSD laptop computer; able to
successfully run a localized agentic AI workflow (Codex/VsCode)
leveraging enhanced graphics capabilities across build features.

# Step 2: Divide Structure Into Chunks

## 💻 PRELIMINARY SPECS
<ul>
<li>✅ <b>MSI GF65 10UE
Thin, 64GB DDR3 Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC (21H2)</b> installed on <b>'C'</b> drive <i>(approximately 250 GB).</i></li>
<li>✅ <b>2 TB 'D' drive</b>; target for installation of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Desktop; currently bare; mounted as NTFS in Windows.</li>
<li>✅ Integrated + discrete GPU; latter is most relevant here; <b>Nvidia RTX 3060 mobile series.</b></li>
</ul>

## 🔎 DESIRED INSTRUCTION

<ul>
<li>👉 Partitioning best practices; including sizes, diversity in mount points (i.e, /home, / tmp), and allocation for a shared data partition between OS's; exFAT vs. NTFS?</li>
<li>👉 Backup suggestions; feasible, periodic .tar exports.</li>
<li>👉 Ability to configure max processor turbo boost frequency caps IN Unix native systemd parameters.</li>
<li>👉 Wayland vs. X11?</li>
</ul>

## 📚 CITED SOURCE PRIORITIZATION
<ul>
<li>1️⃣ Ubuntu developer forums. </li>
<li>2️⃣ Similar Debian-based Linux distro forums.</li>
<li>3️⃣ Credible Reddit threads; top comment has significant upvotes or original post is highly ranked.</li>
<li>4️⃣ Fallback sources; in the event numbers 1-3 surface insufficient information.</li>
</ul>
