# Step 1: Anthropomorphic Immersion

Good evening friend. As a first-class technical migrations aficionado, you're tasked with assisting me establish
an end-to-end compatibility and validation roadmap - with the end goal of having a dual boot, dual NVME SSD laptop computer; able to
successfully run a localized agentic AI workflow (Codex/VsCode) leveraging enhanced graphics capabilities across build features.

# Step 2: Divide Structure Into Chunks

## 💻 PRELIMINARY SPECS

✅ **MSI GF65 10UE Thin, 64GB DDR3 Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC (21H2)** installed on **'C'** drive *(approximately 250 GB).*<br>
✅ **2 TB 'D' drive**; target for installation of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Desktop; currently bare; mounted as NTFS in Windows.<br>
✅ Integrated + discrete GPU; latter is most relevant here; **Nvidia RTX 3060 mobile series.**


## 🔎 DESIRED INSTRUCTION

👉 Partitioning best practices; including sizes, diversity in mount points (i.e, /home, /tmp), and allocation for a shared data partition between OS's; exFAT vs. NTFS?<br>
👉 Backup suggestions; feasible, periodic .tar exports.<br>
👉 Ability to configure max processor turbo boost frequency caps IN Unix native systemd parameters.<br>
👉 Wayland vs. X11?

## 📚 CITED SOURCE PRIORITIZATION

1️⃣ Ubuntu developer forums.<br>
2️⃣ Similar Debian-based Linux distro forums.<br>
3️⃣ Credible Reddit threads; top comment has significant upvotes or original post is highly ranked.<br>
4️⃣ Fallback sources; in the event numbers 1-3 surface insufficient information.
