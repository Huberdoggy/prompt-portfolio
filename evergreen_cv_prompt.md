# Step 1: Establish Universal Baseline - Synthesize Existing Documentation

Good morning o3, I have a task for you.

I am working on creating an evergreen resume, suitable for widespread distribution.
My goal is to "tell Kyle Huber's story" in a manner which is convincing and attractive for stakeholders across various niches in contemporary AI.
So, here's my ask - I want you to analyze the uploaded PDF files; a collective batch of recent tailored
resumes.

When doing so , your objective is to synthesize the most frequent keywords and/or semantically similar assertions concerning my
achievements, used across ALL of said files; under the following section headings:


1️⃣ **Core Competencies**<br>
2️⃣ **Experience/Professional Summary**


To keep this as controlled as possible, the following restraints will be in play:

‼️ **You are only to factor in the sections listed in 1 and 2 above,<br>
and only if a keyword (or closely equivalent phrase approximation, in the case of the 'Professional Summary') occurs at least twice.**

Once completed, provide me with 2 lists:


✅ The first will contain sentences/phrases you identified from the grouping of 'Professional Summaries', which fit my criteria (keep this limited to 5).<br>
✅ Similarly, the second will be keywords/phrases located within the 'Core Competencies'. Again, limit this to no more than 5, listed in order from most frequently occurring to least.


# Step 2: Integrate Into Custom Workflow - Scalable Updates

## 🏁 START HERE
"[Insert PDF file name]" has been uploaded for reference. This constitutes the Universal baseline, mirrors my LinkedIn experience bullets, and serves as a sufficient "catch all" for *Easy Applies* aligning with my domain expertise on said platform. In the event this document is superseded, I will provide an updated version.

## 📜 TIER A (Tailored) CVs

✏️ Always begin from the Universal baseline, which includes canonical project bullets.<br>
✏️ The Professional Summary is customized per role, and the Core Competency mix is tokenized/tuned per JD.<br>
✏️ Additional projects can be added when explicitly directed.

## When Revising Drafts

### If Updating The Universal:

👉 The clean baseline is always the most recently uploaded PDF. This file is canonical until
replaced.

### If Crafting A Tailored (Tier A) CV:
👉 The clean baseline is the Universal CV, retaining canonical bullets.
The summary and competencies are tuned for the role, with optional project inclusions as specified.

## 💡 Formatting Rules

⚠️ Clarus Style remains the formatting standard, unless otherwise noted.<br>
⚠️ Experience headings (employer/dates/roles) must always reflect the Universal CV; ensures truthfulness, LinkedIn consistency, and integrity.<br>
⚠️ If I begin a prompt with phrasing such as "one off," the resultant contents generated should **under no circumstance** persist in memory.
