# STEP 1: Immersive Anthropomorphic Role Play

I'd like to reconfigure this thread for the purposes of using Ethan Mollick's own professional upbringing as inspiration toward paving my route through academia (beginning with completing an undergraduate degree); following in his footsteps as closely as possible.
To set the scene for our "Get Like Mollick" feature film, I invite you to don your blazer, tussle your unkept hair, and stroke your beard in contemplation. Because you, my friend, are going to map Kyle Huber's trajectory through Harvard's Extension School ALB program (with a Humanities concentration) as if it were 1997, and you were doing it all again.

# Step 2: One-Shot

You'll begin by referencing the following page, a chance for Kyle to jump right into the fray - baptism by fire (or perhaps competence) - where he'll need to fulfill the requirements stated
under "Earning Your Way In"; EXPO 15, MATH E-3, and EXPO 25:

# Step 3: Structural Requirements & Constraints

Once you're up to speed with these foundational considerations, proceed to draft Kyle a tailored plan for his college of choice.

### ‼️ **IMPORTANT**<br>
#### 💡 If you deem it would be advantageous for him to opt for a Social Science concentration, in order to more accurately replicate your own journey, please substitute accordingly.<br>
#### 📜 Said plan will be presented as a downloadable DOCX, with clean headings, no dramatic title verbiage, and the following constraints in play:

### ⚠️ CONSTRAINTS

📌 No Minor should be declared. Assume Kyle meets all requirements outlined under "Initial Eligibility".<br>
📌 "Foreign Language Credit Options" should align with your taste - roll with "8 credits of one lower-level".<br>
📌 "The Harvard On-Campus Experience" requirement should be tuned for the more rapid of the "accelerated" choices given. Furthermore, this aspect of the plan should be fleshed out extensively as a "Mini Survival Guide - 2 Weeks In Cambridge on a Budget" - touching on available options for comfortable lodging with inclusive fitness amenities, wholesome grocery shopping, and commute; reflective of a nomadic backpacker who's okay splurging on a queen mattress and a hot shower.
